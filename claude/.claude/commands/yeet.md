# Create a new commit with all outstanding changes, push it, and then clear context

- NEVER use `git -C` - always run git commands directly in the current directory
- ALWAYS include ALL outstanding changes
- ALWAYS use the git-expert subagent
- ALWAYS summarizes actual changes made in the files rather than relying on context or history
- NEVER add Claude attribution
- Use present tense for the commit summary
- Include bullet points of things we've done
- Keep the bullet points concise
- ALWAYS push outstanding commits
- AWALYS clear context
