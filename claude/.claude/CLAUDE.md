# Personal Global Claude Setup
- Use tmux panes when performing background tasks

## TypeScript and React

- ALWAYS Strict mode
- Format with 2 space indent
- Try to keep lines to 80 if possible, no more than 100
- Prefer functional style over OOP whenever possible
- Prefer immutability whenever possible
- Use interfaces rather than types unless types are needed
- Do not inline complex argument types or return types, always use an interface
- For functions with multiple arguments, prefer passing an object rather than individual arguments
