# Personal Global Claude Setup
- ALWAYS use tmux panes when performing background tasks

## TypeScript and React

- ALWAYS Strict mode
- Format with 2 space indent
- Try to keep lines to 80 if possible, no more than 100
- Prefer functional style over OOP whenever possible
- Prefer immutability whenever possible
- Use interfaces rather than types unless types are needed
- Do not inline complex argument types or return types, always use an interface
- For functions with multiple arguments, prefer passing an object rather than individual arguments

## Git and Version Control

- ALWAYS keep commit messages short
- NEVER include yourself as a co-author in a commit
- DO NOT add author or co-author information

## File Handling

- ALWAYS use unix line endings in files
- ALWAYS end files with a newline
